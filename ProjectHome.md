The development of 3D integration significantly improves the bandwidth of network-on-chip (NoC) system. However, the 3D technology-enabled high integration density also brings severe concern of temperature increase, which may impair system reliability and degrade the performance. Task scheduling has been regarded as one effective approach in eliminating thermal hotspot without introducing hardware overhead. However, centralized thermal-aware task scheduling algorithms for 3D NoC is limited for incurring high computation complexity and large volume of monitoring traffic. In this paper, we propose a distributed agent-based thermal-aware task scheduling algorithm for 3D NoC which can provide high scheduling efficiency and significant communication overhead reduction. Experimental results showed that when compared to the centralized thermal-aware task scheduling algorithms, our algorithm achieves up to 76% reduction in monitoring traffic and up to 13 degree reduction in peak temperature. The algorithm also shows great scalability for different scales of NoC system.
